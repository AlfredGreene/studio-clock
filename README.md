## Future Work

* WebSocket connection between multiple clients and the server to sync indicator state.

* REST API to manage indicator state. Supporting integration with audio and vision mixers, Asterisk VoIP server, and door request-entry buttons.

* Re-sync the clock time periodically? PIs don't keep time particularly well.
